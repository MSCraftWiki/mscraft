## Bushi (Technician)

Bushi was the first tech to work on the server, joining the team roughly around the same time that Luna started the server. Bushi is a programmer and sysadmin, providing plugins for the original server and scripts for the current, and final, iteration of the server.

Information about the scripts Bushi has written for the server can be found in our wiki under the KubeJS article.

Non-professionally, Bushi is a guitarist and music nerd, record collector, and the host a weekly radio show which is currently on hiatus due to COVID-19.
