# Server Tweaks

## As supplied by the "Fabrication" mod:
Not everything here will work as intended in case they require a client-side dependency we aren't aware of. This list should be limited only to things that will work on a 100% vanilla client but they haven't all been tested.

* You can push furnace minecarts by right-clicking them without a fuel (Previously a vanilla feature that was then removed)
* Fixes the ghast "charging" animation when they're about to fire a fireball
* Multiple lines of text can be pasted into a sign, you can also copy all the lines of a sign by holding Shift while copying
* Fixes an oversight that prevents silverfish from playing their step sound (which otherwise goes unused)
* Cacti will not break themselves if a block is placed next to them (originally due to engine limitations, and then never removed in vanilla)
* A `/mods` command lists all mods on the server, hovering over a mod shows you its description, clicking on it takes you to its homepage.
* Arrows are more useful underwater.
* Walking through berry bushes with both leggings and boots does not deal damage.
* Touching the side of a cactus with a chestplate equipped will not deal damage.
* Walking on top of a cactus with boots will not deal damage.
* Spawn eggs spawn cracking particles and play a sound when used.
* Creepers light their fuses when lit on fire.
* Cobwebs can burn.
* Ghasts will make use of the unused "scream" sound.
* Sign text colors are less garbage.
* Note blocks can play if any block next to them has a nonsolid face, instead of only if the block above is air.
* Plays the old longer level up sound when you reach level 30.
* You can sneak while punching note blocks to play them in creative mode.
* Sneaking while tuning a note block reduces its pitch rather than increases.
* Shulker bullets respawn when the shulker that shot them is killed.
* Loyalty tridents are immune to void damage, and they start their return timer upon falling into the void.
* Feather Falling V is a valid enchant that completely negates fall damage but does damage to the boots.
* Fire Aspect tools can ignite blocks if you right-click with one equipped, acting as a flint and steel.
* Fire Protection can be applied to any enchantable item, and makes the item immune to fire and lava.
* Furnace minecarts accept any fuel, rather than just coal and charcoal.
* Infinity bows don't require an arrow to fire (janky).
* Invisibility splash potions affect all entities, including arrows and minecarts.
* Placing a block of wool adjacent to a dispenser, dropper, or piston makes it silent.
* Note blocks tell you the note they have been tuned to when tuning it or playing it manually above your hotbar. Also shows the octave, and shows the correct note for the snare and click instruments.
* Note blocks play when landed on. The bigger the fall, the louder the note. Also triggers Observers.
* Observers detect when entities move in front of them if they have no block in front of them.
* Spiders can't climb glazed terracotta.
* Spiders can't climb while wet (i.e. in water or having recently exited water)
* Water source blocks fill in broken blocks instead of air if there is more water on its north, east, south, west and top faces than there is air on its north, east, south, and west faces. In case of a tie, air wins. Makes terraforming lakes and building canals, etc., much less frustrating.
* Repair an anvil by right-clicking it with a Block of Iron
* Entities are considered "wet" for 5 seconds after leaving a source of wetness. Additionally, lingering or splash water bottles inflict wetness. Also makes wet entities drip to show they're wet. Touching lava instantly removes wetness.
* Empty bottles can be used to collect "Obsidian Tears" from Crying Obsidian. When quaffed by or dispensed onto a player, it updates their spawn to the location of the block the tears are from. Dispensers can also be used to fill empty bottles with tears. Crying Obsidian respawn works in any dimension and doesn't need to be recharged, but you spawn with half health, no saturation, less than full food, and Weakness.
* Slow fall splash potions affect inanimate entities (minecarts, arrows, etc.) making them unaffected by gravity. They will become normally affected again if they become wet.
* Anvils only take damage when falling from a height rather than randomly after being used.
* Renaming an item on an anvil always costs one level.
* The Impaling enchantment mirrors Bedrock Edition/Combat Test 4 functionality, namely it does bonus damage to anything that is "wet" (in water, rain, or having recently been in either) instead of only aquatic mobs.
* Disables the anvil prior work penalty when an item has been worked multiple times. Makes non-Mending tools relevant by allowing you to repair them indefinitely, and makes putting books on tools easier.
* Players drop 80% of their experience when dying instead of basically nothing.
* Creeper explosions deal entity damage but not block damage, even while mobGriefing is true.
* Furnace minecarts are very fast and burn fuel more quickly. An attempt to make rail transport relevant again. These carts are so fast that they sometimes fall off of track corners, make sure to surround track corners with blocks.
* Infinity can be put on crossbows.
* Running on soul blocks with Soul Speed will not deal damage to your boots.
* Tridents can accept the Power enchantment, increasing their ranged damage. It is incompatible with Sharpness and Impaling.
* Tridents can accept the Sharpness enchantment, increasing their melee damage. Incompatible with Power and Impaling.
* Disenchant items and receive a book of the enchant in a grindstone by placing the item you wish to disenchant on the top, along with a book on the bottom slot. You will both retain the item and receive a book containing the enchant. 
* Disables the unnecessary "Gear equips" sound that plays when your hands change, and is often glitchily played every tick. Armor equip sounds and other custom equip sounds remain unchanged. You won't even notice it's gone.
