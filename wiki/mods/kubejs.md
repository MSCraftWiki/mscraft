# KubeJS

KubeJS is an implementation of the JavaScript scripting language in Fabric, allowing for, among other things, modifications of vanilla recipes.

For those who recall our original PaperMC server, you'll recall that it contained plugins that [Bushi]("@bushtail#0420") had coded himself. These, along with others, have been re-created by Bushi in KubeJS.

## Scripts

### Bakery

Bakery is a simple plugin to fix a glaring plot hole in Minecraft lore... how on *earth* can you make bread without baking it? Throw one wheat into a Furnace or Smoker and bake yourself some fresh bread!

### BlastStone

Holy crap making stone takes a long time. Not anymore! You can now use the Blast Furnace to make Stone-based, and Sandstone-based blocks, and blasting Sand to make Glass. Sure beats using the boring old Furnace!

### ShinyBlackstone

Surround a block of Blackstone with Gold Nuggets in a crafting table to make yourself some Gilded Blackstone!

### SlabToBlocks

Never have leftover Slabs with this script! Combining two slabs in a crafting table, one over the other, will give you back the slab's full block!
