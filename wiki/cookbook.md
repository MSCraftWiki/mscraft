### Apple Pie
An old time favorite among Nitwits - On a workbench, stitch together
one oak apple, one gram of sugar, and one large egg.

### Bacon
Stretch your pork farm further by taking the time to slice
up a piece of raw pork using a knife and a steady hand on your workbench,
then frying them up with your most-preferred method.

### Cactus Soup
For those that prefer the sandier things in life, quality dining can be difficult.
You subsist only on the word of Dinnerbone and by his grace alone, maybe with a rabbit from time to time.
Fear no more, for the prickliest among you also contains the most moisture around you.
Cut into two portions of the most plump cactus you can find and let their juices drip out into a bowl.

### Candied Apple
Oak apples, as delicious as may be, just might not hit the spot after a rough day of mining. Treat yourself by pouring a bottle of honey over an apple,
with a stick to hold it up with. Clean those sticky fingers afterwards!

### Chocolate Pie
When you're parched, the usual chocolate chip cookies may only serve to make matters worse.
Instead of baking, try combining a handful of those bitter beans with one large egg, and one gram of sugar.

### Roasted Carrot
You can get more nutrition out of a standard farm carrot by roasting it, making it easier for your metabolism to digest the vitamins out of.

### Fried Egg
While intuition may suggest that an egg is only good for baking, the miracles of modern science have enabled it to be eaten directly in a pinch.
Simply crack a egg directly into your oven and watch the magic happen.

*TL Note: Attempt this with non-Chicken, non-Turtle eggs at your own peril. If it's black, stay back.*

### Roasted Spider Eye
A favorite of adventurers in a pinch anywhere, a succulent spider eye that delightfully gushes under your molars unfortunately will
leave one with a bad stomachache while it digests. The poison can be cooked out, and the nutrient availability increased, by roasting
the orb prior to ingesting it. These make an excellent supplement to any diet.

### Honey Bread
Sometimes, simple meals are best whenever resources are limited but you still wish to enjoy yourself. One favorite of mine
is to toast some bread and smear honey on one side of it. A delightful treat for a less-delightful day.

### Melon Pie
Watermelon, as delicious as can be, is time-consuming to... well, consume, and does not leave you feeling satisfied.
I've found that you can make a shockingly delicious pie by combining a whole melon, a gram of sugar, and an egg. Remember to
sew the slices together first.

### Pumpkin Cookie
A friend of mine in the Mud Colony was struggling to satisfy a cookie craving when the nearest jungle was over 2,500 meters away! That simply
couldn't do. I tried replacing the cacao in the standard cookie with a pumpkin instead, and it made a delicious cookie I bring to every family gathering.

### Shepherd Pie
A favorite among the mountainmen of yonder, a warm meat pie consisting of a raw potato, a raw carrot, and some roasted meat from a sheep.

### Sugar Cookie
In greatest times of poverty, you can make a pathetic yet still sweet cookie by combining only equal-parts flour and sugar.

### Sushi
A delicacy for those that live on the seashore: Wrap some raw fish inside some dried kelp with a bit of potato and chopped brown mushroom.
It will become the obsession of your dreams, as long as the fish is fresh.

### Jam
Did you know that sugar will draw water out of fruits? You can make a "sweet sauce" by putting sugar and sweetberries into a jar.

### Sweetberry Bread
What I must confess is that, sweetberry jam is quite strong and tart by itself. It's wonderfully offset by spreading it on some toast,
much like you'd do with honey.

### Sweetberry Pie
No holiday is complete without a traditional Sweetberry Pie. Many will travel hundreds of kilometers just to get sweetberries for this
if they don't grow locally. It's very straightforward as well, simply sugar, egg, and a great handful of ripe sweetberries to get a dessert
that will save your marriage.
