## Join the server with the IP `play.mscraft.org`!

Howdy! Welcome to the official website for the MSCraft Minecraft Server, the official server for the [MSC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/msc). This server, and its website, are lovingly maintained by [@lunaqq#6284](#luna-owner), [@bushtail#0420](#bushi-technician), and [@Chloe#7069](#chloe-technician).

The server runs a custom server-side only modpack called MSCPack, which is a custom-made modpack based around [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc).

## Wiki

Our [Wiki](https://www.mscraft.org/wiki/home) is available to provide any information you will need about our server. This wiki will be kept up-to-date as things change.

## What can MSCraft offer me?

Compared to a 100% vanilla server, we feature:
* Dozens upon dozens of miscellaneous balance changes, tweaks, bug fixes, and improvements. Want the full list?: 
[All Server Tweaks](https://www.mscraft.org/wiki/servertweaks)
* Massively overhauled cave generation that gets more crazy the lower down you go, including cave biomes.
* Dozens of new interesting biomes with custom generation, from cloud-high cliffs to rolling hills to autumnal woods to the iconic fir forests.
* Overhauled biome-specific mineshafts that contain surface openings, workstation cellars, ore deposits at the ends of tunnels, multiple levels of elevation with ladders, abandoned mining outposts, and more.
* Mobs can see farther and are smarter when trying to get to you. Creepers have entirely new A.I. to make them less frustrating and more... creepy.
* Lots of new randomly-generated structures, including biome-specific village types
* Tons of delicious new food items to make, with custom textures.
* Enhanced overworld generation that's faster to generate, and much more interesting.
* Adds a new set of tools, "crooks", which break leaves and grass faster while multiplying their droprates. Also can be used to pull and lift mobs. Craft a wooden crook in the shape of a hoe with only sticks.
* Arrange rotten flesh in an X-shape in a crafting table to make combined flesh, which can be turned into leather in a smoker or on a campfire.
* Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests can be opened from the inventory without being placed first.
* Right-click crops to automatically harvest and replant them.
* The more people sleeping at once, the faster the night passes.
* Ladders don't need to be placed on walls!
* Snow piles up, stacking and getting taller with time, and creating variety in your snowscapes.
* Hovering over blocks shows you what they are, toggleable with `/baila toggle`
* Mobs that prevent you from sleeping are highlighted.
* Villagers have cute permanent random names.
